        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>My name is Gifty Ama Dua Arthur. People usually call me Gifty or MiGi, and I am an international student from Accra, Ghana.
        <p>I spent most of my years growing up in Ghana and some part of it in Angola, where I learned to speak fluent Portuguese (or used to for some time). 
            I love experiencing diverse cultures and I believe one of the first steps in breaking cultural barriers is through language learning. This actually has been the force behind my goal of attaining fluency in seven international languages. Whooohoo!</p>
        <p>I'm a currently a Junior pursuing a Computer Science and Busisness Management double major degree, and French Minor. It seems to be a lot on my plate, but truth is... I am an aspiring JD/MBA. 
            I am an all-round student with a passion for civil rights issues, religious studies and sports. I am also interested in Business Administration, Law as well as IT. My experience at Luther so far has been great! I currently live in Miller hall, and I'm an active member of College Ministries, ISAA and BTQ.</p>
