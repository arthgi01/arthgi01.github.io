        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>My name is Gifty Ama Dua Arthur. People usually call me Gifty or MiGi, and I am an international student from Accra, Ghana.
        <p>I spent most of my years growing up in Ghana and some part of it in Angola, where I learned to speak fluent Portuguese (or used to for some time). I love experiencing diverse cultures and I believe one of the first steps in breaking cultural barriers is through language learning. This actually has been the force behind my goal of attaining fluency in seven international languages. Whooohoo!</p>
