        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>My name is Gifty Ama Dua Arthur. People usually call me <b>Gifty</b> or <b>MiGi</b>, and I am an international student from Accra, Ghana.
        <p>I spent most of my years growing up in Ghana and some part of it in Angola, where I learned to speak fluent Portuguese... (or used to for some time) but now I'm proficient in speaking French! <i>Whoohoo!!</i>.
            If you'd want to learn French or any other international language, visit this website called <a href = "https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>.
          <i>Thank me later! :D</i>. 
            I love experiencing diverse cultures and I believe one of the first steps in breaking cultural barriers is through language learning. This actually has been the force behind my goal of attaining fluency in seven international languages. In other words, I'm a polyglot in the making. </p>
        <h2>Life at Luther - GO NORSE!!!</h2>
          <p>I'm a currently a Junior pursuing a Computer Science and Busisness Management double major degree, and French Minor. It seems to be a lot on my plate, but truth is... I am an aspiring JD/MBA. 
              I am an all-round student with a passion for civil rights issues, religious studies and sports. I am also interested in Business Administration, Law as well as IT. My experience at Luther so far has been great! 
               I currently live in Miller hall, and I'm an active member of College Ministries, ISAA and BTQ.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>During my spare time I love to watch movies, or participate in outdoor events like soccer or volleyball. I've also come to like coding software programs, thanks to my first few classes in CS, and I hope build on this new-found interest and come up with a life-changing project!
          My interests are well detailed on the link to my Hobbies Page, so do check it out. 
          I am also an Independent Business owner for Amway and I'll be glad if you'd take time to visit my <a href = "http://www.amway.com/GiftyArthur">Store</a> right here.
